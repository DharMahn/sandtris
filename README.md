Clear lines with the same colored particles connected from left to right, or blow them up to gain points.

For each 10000 points you get a bomb, which can be used as a crutch, or as a way to remove walls/obstacles if you have them turned on. You can even use multiple of them at the same time for a bigger explosion.
